# AssetLoader

## Use
To use the production version of the AssetLoader, find dist/AssetLoader.min.js

## Development
To start developing for AssetLoader, or better the documentation, run from this folder:
    bower install
    npm install

Then to update the documentation, run from this folder:
    sh/generateDocs.sh

For best compression of production code, AssetLoader is built with Mink. At this time there is not yet a public Mink service in operation. That may change in the future.

## Documentation
To view the documentation run from this folder:
    npm install
    node server.js

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000/doc in your web browser.
