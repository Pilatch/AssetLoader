# AssetLoader

## Use
To use the production version of the AssetLoader, find dist/AssetLoader.min.js

## Development and Documentation
To start developing for AssetLoader, or better the documentation, run from the base folder:

    bower install
    npm install
    node server.js

To view the documentation navigate to http://localhost:3000/doc in your web browser.

For best compression of production code, AssetLoader is built with Mink. At this time there is not yet a public Mink service in operation. That may change in the future. Employees of GSI Commerce // eBay Enterprise have access to this service.
